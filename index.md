## Hello!


I am Bhrij ("Bridge") Patel. I am a fourth-year CS PhD student at the UMD - College Park.
I am co-advised by [Dr. Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha) as part of the [GAMMA](https://gamma.umd.edu/) lab and by [Dr. Amrit Singh Bedi](https://sites.google.com/view/amritsinghbedi/home) (UCF). My work focuses on connecting theory and practice for <strong>principled policy learning and alignment with suboptimal feedback signals.</strong> 
I have also interned at [Emergence AI](https://www.emergence.ai/company) working on learning API functionality for tool-based agents.
Before my PhD, I graduated from Duke University ('22) with a double major in CS and Math and a minor in Creative Writing. During my undergrad, I was advised by [Dr. Cynthia Rudin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFAkntpj2aOBJ1q4o4FhVwQ/featured) in her [Interpretable ML Lab](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/).

My current research interests:
<ul>
  <li>Alignment and Personalization for AI Systems, specifically during Test-Time</li>
  <li>Planning for LLM-powered Digital and Embodied Agents</li>
  <li>LLM-based Evaluators for Prompt Optimization</li>
  <li>Sample Efficient Optimization for Reinforcement Learning with Sparse Rewards</li>
</ul>

<!-- <p style="color:red;">üîç I am currently looking for research or industry internships for Summer and Fall 2025 in the areas of Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and/or LLM Systems. Feel free to reach out!</p> -->
<p style="color:blue;">[June 2025] I started interning at Qualcomm for Summer/Fall 2025, working on agent planning for on-device LLMs!</p>

<p style="color:blue;">[May 2025] Completed my internship at Emergence AI, writing a research paper on learning API functionality from demonstrations for tool-based agents!</p>
