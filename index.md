## Hello!


I am Bhrij ("Bridge") Patel. I am a fourth-year CS PhD student at the UMD - College Park.
I am co-advised by [Dr. Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha) as part of the [GAMMA](https://gamma.umd.edu/) lab and by [Dr. Amrit Singh Bedi](https://sites.google.com/view/amritsinghbedi/home) (UCF). My work focuses on theory and practice for <strong>reliable, robust reasoning with suboptimal feedback signals.</strong> I am currently interning at AG2 (formerly AutoGen) for LLM-based agents. I have also interned at Qualcomm Research and Emergence AI working on tool-based agents. Before my PhD, I graduated from Duke University ('22), advised by [Dr. Cynthia Rudin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFAkntpj2aOBJ1q4o4FhVwQ/featured) in her [Interpretable ML Lab](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/).

My current research interests:
<ul>
  <li>Test-Time Alignment and Personalization for AI Systems</li>
  <li>Multi-step Tasks with Tool-based Agents</li>
  <li>LLM-based Evaluators and Reward Modeling</li>
  <li>Memory and Experience Distillation for Continual Learning</li>
  <li>Sample Efficient Optimization for Reinforcement Learning with Sparse Rewards</li>
</ul>

<!-- <p style="color:red;">🔍 I am currently looking for research or industry internships for Summer and Fall 2025 in the areas of Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and/or LLM Systems. Feel free to reach out!</p> -->
