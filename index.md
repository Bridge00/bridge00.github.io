## About Me

I am currently a 4th year CS Ph.D. student at the [University of Maryland](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), supervised by [Professor Ming Lin](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~lin/) at the [GAMMA Group](https://gamma.umd.edu/). My north star in research is safer, more transparent, and interpretable autonomous driving. 
I believe that designing deep learning frameworks for driving with interpretable and transferable priors in mind will ultimately lead to safer, socially-viable, and impactful policies. 
More specifically, my research interest involves combining simulation techniques and deep learning for autonomous driving and general multi-agent interaction scenarios. 
While this paradigm has been explored for physics-based simulation, applying it to traffic simulation is challenging since existing mathematical models of simulation describe approximations (rather than exact paths) of human beings. 
<!-- This extends to topics in learning-based computer vision, multi-agent interaction modeling, traffic simulation, and HCI user studies in my projects.  -->
Previously, I interned at Kitware with Brian Clipp and at NASA Goddard SFC / ADNET Systems with Arif Albayrak, William Teng, and Mohammad Khayat.

I will be interning at Waymo UK this upcoming Summer 2024!

## Hobbies and Side Quests
FPS and RPG games are one of my favorite past times. Currently, I play VALORANT and Genshin Impact. Two of my favorite titles of all time are Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and [Enderal: Forgotten Stories](https://store.steampowered.com/app/933480/Enderal_Forgotten_Stories/), which started out as a Skyrim mod but has a beautiful storyline and fun combat mechanics. I can't recommend Enderal enough.. if you like Skyrim, you will love Enderal. 

I also played on the UMD women's club ice hockey team from 2016-2019 as left wing. It was a blast. Check out the team [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/terpswhockey/) if you want to support!

Here's a playlist of various uploads from my childhood YouTube account, where I post funny music/skating performance videos, gaming montages and the occasional travel vlog:
